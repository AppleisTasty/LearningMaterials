This is a theory raised by Lujin, based on his personal learning experience.
Notice: This may not apply to everyone.
# The AIRA theory
The typical learning experience has 4 stages: absorbing, integrating, reflecting and applying. Each of the stage plays an irreplaceble role. When people start to acquire knowledge, they used to do it aimlessly, in this theory, we summary how a complete process of learning happens and how we manage to learn everything in a better way.

The critical thinking: what is your actual target? Is this really your target? Is there a true target underneath this target?

Happiness: star 0-5;
Growth: star 0-5;
if happiness = 0, then growth = 5;
Principle: do not make yourself happy, do not entertain yourself.
consistency: days

Four stages of the learning experience:
Period one: absorbing
In this period, Learn about WHAT: principles, terminologies, concepts
Period two: integrating
In this period, Learn about HOW: connections, hierarchy/category, problem models/methods. Usually this is how you handle exams, tests.
Period three: reflecting
In this period, Learn about WHY: cross-disciplinary, natural phenomenon, what its connection to the world, learn from the world
Period four: applying
In this period, Learn about Creativity: What's underneath these concepts, what its actually telling you, what ability it trained you.
(after period four its period one)
